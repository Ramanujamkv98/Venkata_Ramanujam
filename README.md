<h2 align="center">Analyst | SQL • Tableau • Predictive & Descriptive Analytics | MSBA ASU (Dec 2025)</h2>

I'm a Data Analyst and MSBA student at ASU, graduating in December 2025, with experience across healthcare, fintech, and ed-tech analytics. Before joining the MSBA program, I worked in roles spanning business intelligence, analytics, where I built dashboards, automated reporting pipelines, and delivered insights that improved retention, attribution accuracy, and campaign ROI.

For the last one year, I’ve been immersed in structured academic and real-world analytics work through my MSBA program. During the weekends, I’m a tinkerer—exploring small AI, automation, and data projects simply because I’m passionate about building, learning, and improving through hands-on experimentation.

I'm passionate about SQL, KPI analytics, and predictive analytics, and I'm actively exploring how modern data stack concepts can enhance real-world decision-making.
