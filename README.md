<h2 align="center">Analyst | SQL • Tableau • Predictive & Descriptive Analytics | MSBA ASU (Dec 2025)</h2>

I'm a Data Analyst and MSBA student at ASU, graduating in December 2025, with experience across healthcare, fintech, and ed-tech analytics. Before joining the MSBA program, I worked in roles spanning business intelligence, analytics, where I built dashboards, automated reporting pipelines, and delivered insights that improved retention, attribution accuracy, and campaign ROI.

During the week, I work on structured academic and real-world analytics projects—from inventory optimization at HonorHealth to supply chain forecasting tools and AI-driven business analyst assistants. On weekends, I’m a tinkerer, experimenting with small AI, automation, and data projects that help me learn faster and build better.

I'm passionate about SQL, KPI analytics, and predictive analytics, and I'm actively exploring how modern data stack concepts can enhance real-world decision-making.
